- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoseAugustoRocha
- 👀 I’m interested in learning simple programming languages such as Python and get familiar with SQL
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python in the beginner stage
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python development and C# in the future. I hope to be a back-end developer in the future.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have never worked as a programmer and I feel lost in the beginning. I ask for help for anyone who read this profile
